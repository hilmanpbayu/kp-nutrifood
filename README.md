## Description

Collaboration between Nutrifood and Telkom University to assist Nutrifood in answering key questions about how to predict organizational culture values using data obtained from the company's social networks, particularly in the form of anonymous text, ensuring that the identities of respondents are not disclosed in this study.

## Objective

- Build a machine learning classification application based on enterprise social media data owned by Nutrifood.
- Support application development activities according to the predetermined stages, starting from designing the application, implementing it, and conducting literature studies.
- Provide job preparation training delivered by both Telkom University and Nutrifood representatives.

## Summary

This research aims to classify real and fake news from a Kaggle dataset related to political, social, cultural, and other topics using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). The results obtained from a dataset containing 44,898 entries show an accuracy of 100%, a precision of 99%, and a recall of 100%. The F1-Score is 100%, indicating that the system performs well in classification tasks. The high recall value is also highly beneficial in detecting fake news. Future research is recommended to conduct further experiments, particularly on the hyperparameters of the BERT method.
